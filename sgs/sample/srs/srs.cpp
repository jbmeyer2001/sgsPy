/**
 * This is a helper function used for determine the probability multiplier for a given raster.
 * The probability of any given function being added is the number of samples divided by the
 * number of total pixels. 
 *
 * Rather than storing the indexes of all possible (accessible, not nan) pixels, which is potentially
 * encredibly memory-inefficient for large rasters, it is much better to only store the indexes
 * of roughly the number of total pixels we need to sample. A random number generator is used 
 * for each pixel which is a candidate for being added as a sample. The sample is retained if 
 * the random number generator creates a series of 1's for the first n bits. This value n determines 
 * the probability a sample is added. For example, if n were three then 1/8 or 1/(2^n) pixels would
 * be sampled.
 *
 * It can be seen that setting up an n value which is close to the probability samples/pixels but
 * an over estimation would result in an adequte number of indexes stored WITHOUT storing a
 * rediculous number of values.
 *
 * The way this number n is enforced, is by determining a multiplier that takes the form of the first
 * n bits are 1 and the remaining are 0. For example:
 * 1 	-> 00000001 	-> 50%
 * 3 	-> 00000011 	-> 25%
 * 7 	-> 00000111 	-> 12.5%
 * 63 	-> 00111111	-> 1.56%
 *
 * The AND of this multiplier is taken with the rng value, and the result of that and is compared against
 * the multiplier. The 0's from the and remove the unimportant bits, and the 1's enforce the first n
 * values at the beginning.
 *
 * The multiplier is determined by determining the numerator and denominator of this probability (samples/pixels),
 * with extra multipliers for an unknonwn amount of nan values, and multiplying by extra if the mindist parameter
 * is passed as it may cause samples to be thrown out. Further, if an access vector is given and all samples 
 * must fall within the accessible area, the probability is increased by the ratio of the total area in the raster
 * to the accessible area. The probability would then simply be numerator/denominator, but we want a multiplier
 * with a specific number of bits not a small floating point value. The log base 2 is used to transform this division
 * int a subtraction problem, resulting in the number of bits. The value 1 is then left shifted by the number of bits,
 * and subtracted by 1 to give the multiplier.
 *

 * @param int numSamples

/**
 * This function uses random sampling to determine the location
 * of sample plots given a raster image.
 *
 * First, metadata is acquired on the first raster band, which is 
 * to be read to check and ensure samples don't occur over nodata pixels.
 *
 * Next, and output vector dataset is created as an in-memory dataset.
 * If the user specifies a filename, this in-memory dataset will be 
 * written to disk in a different format after all points have been added.
 *
 * An Access struct is created, which creates a raster dataset containing
 * a rasterized version of access buffers. This raster will be 1 over
 * accessible areas. In the case where there is no access vector given,
 * the structs 'used' member will be false and no processing or rasterization
 * will be done.
 *
 * An Existing struct is created, which retains information on already existing
 * sample points passed in the form of a vector dataset. The points are iterated
 * through and added to the output dataset. The points are also added to a set,
 * and during iteration the indexes of every pixel will be checked against this set
 * to ensure there are no duplicate pixels. In the case whre there is no existing
 * vector given, the structs 'used' member will be false and no processing
 * will be done.
 *
 * Next, a rng() function is created usign the xoshiro library, the specific
 * randm number generator is the xoshrio256++
 * https://vigna.di.unimi.it/ftp/papers/ScrambledLinear.pdf	
 *
 * The impetus behind usign the rng() function to determine which pixels
 * should be added DURING iteration, rather than afterwards, is it removes the
 * necessity of storing every available pixel, which quickly becomes extrordinarily
 * inefficient for large rasters. Rather, for pixels which are accessible, not nan,
 * and not already existing, there is a pre-determined percentage chance to be stored
 * which uses this random number generator. An over-estimation for the percentage
 * chance is made, because it is better to have too many than not enough possible options
 * to sample from. This over-estimation might result in the storage of 2x-3x extra pixels
 * rather than the many orders of magnitude extra storage of adding all pixels. The
 * calculation for this percentage is done and explained in detail in the
 * getProbabilityMultiplier() function.
 *
 * The raster is then processed in blocks, each block is read into memory,
 * and potentially the block of the access raster is read into memory as well.
 * The processBlock() funciton is called depending on the data type of the 
 * raster, to add the available / chosen pixel indices.
 *
 * Once the entire raster has been iterated through, there may be extra
 * indices in the indicies vector. Because simply sampling the first
 * few we need would NOT be random, the indices are first shuffled.
 * After being shuffled, the indexes are added to the output dataset
 * as samples if they don't occur within mindist if an already existing pixel.
